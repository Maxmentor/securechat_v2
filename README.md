SecureChat is a lightweight and privacy-focused PHP chat application where users can start chatting instantly by entering a Username and a Room ID. No login or registration is required.

Users who enter the same Room ID are automatically connected to the same chat room.
If any user refreshes the page, the entire chat history is automatically deleted.

This makes SecureChat perfect for temporary and private conversations.
